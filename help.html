                                        You can also assign tasks to other members of your team or invite new contacts to join. 
                                        Additionally, you can set a due date for the task and add subtasks to further break down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces.

                                        With Join's kanban board, you can easily view the current status of your tasks and make updates as needed. 
                                        Simply drag and drop a task to change its status, or edit the task details as needed. 
                                        This makes it easy to stay on top of your work and ensure that everything is moving forward as planned.
